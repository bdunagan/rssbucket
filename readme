RssBucket is a simple RSS reader for your Mac. You can add feeds, see badges for how many entries are in the view, view the feed entries, and click a link arrow to jump to that entry's webpage. It's completely free, so borrow any code you find useful. However, it is 10.5 only and requires Xcode 3.0.

If you're looking for an RSS reader to actually use, go with NetNewsWire. :)
